# to-do-list_with_Django
Creating a To-Do-List app with the Django Framework and Python, (some BootStrap)
This is a simple way to create a web based to do list application
I have used Django Framework. And there is some Bootstrap used as well.
I have used csrf_exempt to avoid the use of csrf_token as I was using virtual machine.
If you are using this code in your local machine, please use the csrf_token.
